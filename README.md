# eohRESTWebService
EOH Assessment

# How to run
* To start the server, run `EohApplication.java`. This will start the embedded tomcat at port 8080

## Then open the broswer and access the app as follows
* To view the database, go to: http://localhost:8080/h2
* To interact with the RESTful endpoints, I put up Spring Swagger2-Ui to help around with that: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
* This will give you a view of the controllers in place and their exposed service endpoints.
* Now, you can click on any endpoint and start playing with it. To persist you will have to add invoice.
* Avoid inserting any values for "id" fields as they are to be generated by the database, yah?
